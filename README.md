Emulator for the S6B0108 LCD display.

Implements basic functionality to write commands and data to the screen and
to read from it. Also implements basic inpus (cursor keys).

Build with make. Run under X11, so these are the required libraries.

Observe that this is a work in progress, and it's not assured that code that
runs on the emulator work on the hardware.
